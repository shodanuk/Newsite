# newsite.sh

Sets up a new site on Mac OSx Snow Leopard.  

* Creates site root folder
* Sets up a new Virtual Host
* Adds an entry to the hosts file
* Restarts apache

## Usage

Move (or symlink) newsite.sh and default.txt to /usr/bin (or somewhere appropriate)

Then run:

sudo newsite.sh sitename

That will create:

* ~/Sites/sitename folder
* sitename.conf in /etc/apache2/other
* 127.0.0.1 sitename.localhost in /etc/hosts

## Assumptions

Your httpd.conf is configured to load all .conf files in /etc/apache2/other
